title: Summary and Best Practices
---


### When to use each technique:

1. **String Methods**: Best for simple operations on well-structured text
   - Splitting, joining, case changes, simple replacements
   - Fast and built-in to Python

2. **Regular Expressions**: Best for pattern matching and extraction
   - When you need to find or replace text that follows specific patterns
   - Extracting structured data from text
   - Validating formats (emails, phone numbers, etc.)

3. **Fuzzy Matching**: Best for comparing similar but not identical strings
   - Handling user input with typos or variations
   - Deduplicating data where entries might differ slightly
   - Searching for approximate matches

### Performance Considerations:

- String methods are fastest
- Regex is powerful but can be slower for complex patterns
- Fuzzy matching is the most computationally intensive
- Precompile regex patterns when reusing them
- Normalize strings before comparison to improve match quality
